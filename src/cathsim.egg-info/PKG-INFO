        Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
        does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
        Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
        other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related
        information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no
        warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their

        Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
        
        Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
        conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
        original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
        and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
        following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
        exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
        
             Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
             intended for use by those authorized to give the public
             permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
             copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
             irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
             and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
             Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
             applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
             material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
             material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
             licensed material, or material used under an exception or
             limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:

             Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
             licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
             licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
             the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
             example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
             copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
             licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
             other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
             the licensed material may still be restricted for other
             reasons, including because others have copyright or other
             rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
             such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
             Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
             respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations
             for the public:

        interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in
        consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the

             terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
             all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the

             available to the public including in ways that members of the
             public may access the material from a place and at a time
             individually chosen by them.
        
          m. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright

             the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
             as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
             equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
        
          n. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
             under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
        
        
        Section 2 -- Scope.
        
          a. License grant.
        
               1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
                  the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
                  non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
                  exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
        
                    a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
                       in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and
        
                    b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for
                       NonCommercial purposes only.
        
               2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
                  Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
                  License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
                  its terms and conditions.
        
               3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
                  6(a).
        
               4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
                  Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
                  all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
                  and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
                  Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
                  authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
                  necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
                  technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
                  Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
                  simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
                  (4) never produces Adapted Material.
        
               5. Downstream recipients.
        
                    a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
                       recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
                       receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
                       Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
                       Public License.
        
                    b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.
                       Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
                       automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
                       exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
                       under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.
        
                    c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
                       any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
                       apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
                       Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
                       Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
                       Material.
        
               6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
                  may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
                  are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
                  with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
                  the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
                  provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
        
          b. Other rights.
        
               1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
                  licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
                  privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
                  the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
                  assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
                  extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
                  Rights, but not otherwise.
        
               2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
                  Public License.
        
               3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
                  collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
                  Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
                  under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
                  licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
                  reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when
                  the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial
                  purposes.
        
        
        Section 3 -- License Conditions.
        
        Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
        following conditions.

                    a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
                       with the Licensed Material:
        
                         i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed

                            attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                            the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                            designated);
        
                        ii. a copyright notice;
        
                       iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
        
                        iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                            warranties;
        
                         v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                            extent reasonably practicable;
        
                    b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
                       retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
        
                    c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
                       Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
                       hyperlink to, this Public License.
        
               2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
                  reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
                  which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
                  reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
                  hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
                  information.
               3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
                  information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
                  reasonably practicable.
        
          b. ShareAlike.
        
             In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
             Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.
        
               1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons
                  license with the same License Elements, this version or
                  later, or a BY-NC-SA Compatible License.
        
               2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the
                  Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition
                  in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
                  context in which You Share Adapted Material.
        
               3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
                  or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
                  Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the
                  rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.
        
        
        Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
        
        Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
        apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
        
          a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
             to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
             portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes
             only;
        
          b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
             contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
             Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
             Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,
             including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
        
          c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
             all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

        replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
        Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
        
        
        Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
        
          a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
             EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
             AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
             ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
             IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
             WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
             PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
             ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
             KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
             ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
        
          b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
             TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
             NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
             INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
             COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
             USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
             ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
             DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
             IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
        
          c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
             above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
             possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
             waiver of all liability.
        
        
        Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
        
          a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
             Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
             this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
             terminate automatically.
        
          b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
             Section 6(a), it reinstates:
        
               1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
                  it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
                  violation; or
        
               2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
        
             For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
             right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
             of this Public License.
        
          c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
             Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
             distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
             will not terminate this Public License.
        
          d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
             License.
        
        
        Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
        
          a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
             terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
        
          b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
             Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
             independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
        
        
        Section 8 -- Interpretation.
        
          a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
             shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
             conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
             be made without permission under this Public License.
        
          b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
             deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
             minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
             cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
             without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
             conditions.
        
          c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
             failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
             Licensor.
        
          d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
             as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
             that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
             processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

6. [Mesh Processing](#mesh-processing)
7. [Adding Elements](#adding-elements)


## Requirements
1. Ubuntu (tested with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)
2. Miniconda (tested with Miniconda 23.5)
3. Python 3.9

If `miniconda` is not installed run the following for a quick Installation. Note: the script assumes you use `bash`.

```bash
# installing miniconda
mkdir -p ~/.miniconda3
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py39_23.5.2-0-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/.miniconda3/miniconda.sh
bash ~/.miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/.miniconda3
rm -rf ~/.miniconda3/miniconda.sh
~/.miniconda3/bin/conda init bash
source .bashrc
```

## Installation

1. Create a `conda environment`:

```bash
conda create -n cathsim python=3.9
conda activate cathsim
```

2. Install the environment:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:airvlab/cathsim
cd cathsim
pip install -e .
```

## Quickstart

A quick way to have the environment run with gym is to make use of the `make_dm_env` function and then wrap the resulting environment into a `DMEnvToGymWrapper` resulting in a `gym.Env`.

```python
import cathsim.gym.envs
import gymnasium as gym

task_kwargs = dict(
    dense_reward=True,
    success_reward=10.0,
    delta=0.004,
    use_pixels=False,
    use_segment=False,
    image_size=64,
    phantom="phantom3",
    target="bca",
)

env = gym.make("cathsim/CathSim-v0", **task_kwargs)


obs = env.reset()
for _ in range(1):
    action = env.action_space.sample()
    obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)
    for obs_key in obs:
        print(obs_key, obs[obs_key].shape)
    print(reward)
    print(terminated)
    print(truncated)
    for info_key in info:
        print(info_key, info[info_key])
```

Being a `gym` interface, it is compatible with RL libraries such as `stable_baselines3`:
```python
import cathsim.gym.envs
from stable_baselines3 import SAC

model = SAC("MultiInputPolicy", "cathsim/CathSim-v0").learn(10000)
```

For a list of the environment libraries at the current time, see the accompanying `environment.yml`

## Training 

#### Network Models

| ENN Model | BC Model |
|:--------:|:--------:|
| <img height="293" width="auto" alt="expert network architecture" src="./misc/expert_model.png"> | <img height="293" width="auto" alt="bc network architecture" src="./misc/bc_model.png"> |


In order to train the models available run:
```bash
bash ./scripts/train.bash
```

The script will create a `results` directory on the `cwd`. The script saves the data in `<trial-name>/<phantom>/<target>/<model>` format. Each model has three subfolders `eval`, `models` and `logs`, where the evaluation data contains the `Trajectory` data resulting from the evaluation of the policy, the `models` contains the `pytorch` models and the `logs` contains the `tensorboard` logs.

##### Path Comparison

## Manual Control

For a quick visualisation of the environment run:
```bash
run_env
```
You will now see the guidewire and the aorta along with the two sites that represent the targets. You can interact with the environment using the keyboard arrows.


## Mesh Processing

You can use a custom aorta by making use of V-HACD convex decomposition. To do so, you can use stl2mjcf, available [here](https://github.com/tudorjnu/stl2mjcf). You can quickly install the tool with:

```bash
pip install git+git@github.com:tudorjnu/stl2mjcf.git
```

After the installation, you can use `stl2mjcf --help` to see the available commands. The resultant files can be then added to `cathsim/assets`. The `xml` will go in that folder and the resultant meshes folder will go in `cathsim/assets/meshes/`. 

Note: You will probably have to change the parameters of V-HACD for the best results.

## Adding Elements

### Adding a Phantom

Following the steps from [mesh processing](#mesh-processing), the easiest way is to add the files to the correct directory, namely `src/cathsim/dm/components/phantom_assets/`. From here, you can simply select the phantom based on its name. For example, assuming your phantom is named `my_phantom.xml`, you would simply call:

```python
import cathsim.gym.envs
import gymnasium as gym

task_kwargs = dict(
    phantom="my_phantom",
    target=[0.1, 0.1, 0.1],  # select a target based on the mesh or embed it into the xml
)

env = gym.make("cathsim/CathSim-v0", **task_kwargs)
```

For more control, you could set the aorta using `mjcf`. See `src/cathsim/dm/components/phantom.py` and `src/cathsim/dm/components/base_models.py` for an example on how to do this. You can then just add the phantom to the task as such:

```python
from cathsim.gym.envs import CathSim

phantom = MyPhantom()
tip = Tip(n_bodies=4)
guidewire = Guidewire(n_bodies=80)
task = Navigate(
    phantom=phantom,
    guidewire=guidewire,
    tip=tip,
    target=target,
    **kwargs,
)
env = composer.Environment(
    task=task,
    random_state=random_state,
    strip_singleton_obs_buffer_dim=True,
)

env = CathSim(dm_env=env)
```

## Adding a guidewire

A guidewire can be created similarly to the phantom and then embedded into the task like above.

*Please see more information on `mjcf` [here](https://github.com/google-deepmind/dm_control/tree/main/dm_control/mjcf).*
