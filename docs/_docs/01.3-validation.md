We validate our CathSim simulator and robots through testing on both phantom models and animal subjects.

## Phantom Setup

</div>

To simulate human vascular anatomy, we use a half-body vascular phantom model, which is housed in a transparent box and connected to a closed water circuit to mimic blood flow.

We utilize a Bi-planar X-ray system equipped with 60 kW Epsilon X-ray Generators and 16-inch Image Intensifier Tubes, incorporating dual focal spot Varian X-ray tubes for high-definition imaging.

## Animal Setup

</div>
We use pigs as animal subjects for our validation, as their anatomy shares similarities with that of humans.


## Target
<div class="image-container">

</div>
The catheterization targets for our procedures are the brachiocephalic artery (BCA) and the left common carotid artery (LCCA).


## SplineFormer Network

We propose SplineFormer, a new transformer-based architecture, designed specifically to predict the continuous, smooth shape of the guidewire in an explainable wa


## Expert Navigation Network

</div>
Our Expert Navigation Network (ENN) is a multimodal system trained using CathSim and subsequently transferred to operate on the real robot.


## Segmentation Model

</div>
CathEase is an accessible and cost-effective endovascular robot that focuses on translating and rotating the guidewire. It uses a Nema 17 stepper motor for translation, an additional motor for rotation, and is controlled by an Arduino Uno Rev3 with a CNC shield and two A4899 drivers, powered by a 12V DC source. Teleoperation input is provided through a Google Stadia joystick.
