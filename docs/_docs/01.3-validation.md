We develop endovascular robotic systems specifically designed to assist in robot-assisted catheterization tasks. The robotic platforms integrate seamlessly with the CathSim simulator, providing a comprehensive toolset for researchers and clinicians to explore endovascular techniques.

CathEase is an accessible and cost-effective endovascular robot that focuses on translating and rotating the guidewire. It uses a Nema 17 stepper motor for translation, an additional motor for rotation, and is controlled by an Arduino Uno Rev3 with a CNC shield and two A4899 drivers, powered by a 12V DC source. Teleoperation input is provided through a Google Stadia joystick.
