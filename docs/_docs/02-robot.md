We develop endovascular robotic systems specifically designed to assist in robot-assisted catheterization tasks. The robotic platforms integrate seamlessly with the CathSim simulator, providing a comprehensive toolset for researchers and clinicians to explore, refine, and practice advanced endovascular techniques.

The CathSim simulator includes four components: Follower Robot, Aorta Phantom, Guidewire Model, Blood Simulation and AR/VR.

Detailed 3D meshes from silicone-based phantoms are used to simulate different aortic structures. Convex hulls generated through V-HACD simplify collision modeling.
